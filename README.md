##RecipeAPP

This project is part of my virtual internship program.
In this project, I've improvised the module for the user to share their local and 
authentic foood recipe with the world using this app through the 
AddRecipe module that just benn added by me.

##AICTE-Edunate Foundation 
This internship has provided me the knowledge to implement the MERN technologies 
on the app through building an interactive and robust frontend, smooth and flexible backend flow.

I've gained hands-on experience on the projects developing in the IT industry using MERN Stack.
